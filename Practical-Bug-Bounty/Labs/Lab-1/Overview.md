# Lab 1: Brute-Force Attacks ðŸšªðŸ”“

## Goal
The objective of this lab was to identify valid credentials for a target login system through brute-force attacks using the `ffuf` tool.

## Key Focus
- Testing for weak authentication mechanisms.
- Utilizing wordlists to simulate brute-force attacks.
- Filtering responses to pinpoint unique behaviors indicating potential vulnerabilities.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Tool Used:** ffuf (Fuzz Faster U Fool)
- **Wordlist:** `/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-10000.txt`
- **Filter Used:** Response size filtering to exclude common response pages.
