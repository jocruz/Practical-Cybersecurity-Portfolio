# Findings and Remediation üßêüõ†Ô∏è

## Findings
- **Identified Vulnerability:** Weak authentication mechanism susceptible to brute-force attacks.
- **Evidence:** The password `letmein` returned a unique response (Size: 1808 bytes) different from the standard failure response (Size: 1814 bytes).

## Remediation
1. **Implement Rate Limiting:** Restrict the number of login attempts allowed within a short period.
2. **Use Account Lockout:** Temporarily disable accounts after multiple failed login attempts.
3. **Password Complexity Requirements:** Enforce strong password policies.
4. **Logging and Monitoring:** Monitor for unusual login behavior, such as multiple failed attempts.
