# üåê XML External Entity (XXE) Injection Overview

## ‚ùì What is XXE?

XML External Entity Injection (XXE) is a security vulnerability that exploits weaknesses in the way an XML parser processes input. This vulnerability occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. 

---

## üí° Key Concepts for Interviews

### **Definition:**
Explain what XXE is and why it's dangerous.

Example: "XXE allows attackers to access server files or execute requests on behalf of the server by injecting malicious XML."

### **Common Scenarios:**
- Applications accepting XML input (e.g., SOAP services, REST APIs, file uploads).
- Misconfigured XML parsers that allow external entity processing.

### **Impacts:**
- **File Disclosure:** Access to sensitive files like `/etc/passwd` on Linux.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exhausting resources with recursive entity definitions.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Making the server perform requests to internal/external systems.

### **Prevention Tips:**
- Disable external entities in XML parsers.
- Use modern libraries or formats (e.g., JSON).
- Employ strict input validation.

## üíª Example Interview Question:

**"What is XXE, and how would you prevent it?"**

**Answer:**  
"XXE is a vulnerability that occurs when an XML parser processes external entities. Attackers can exploit this to access sensitive files or send unauthorized requests. To prevent XXE, I would disable external entity resolution in the XML parser, validate and sanitize input, and use safer formats like JSON."

## üõ† Example Exploits to Know

### **File Disclosure**
- **XML Input:**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [  
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]>
<creds>
    <user>&xxe;</user>
    <password>12345</password>
</creds>
```
- **Outcome:** Contents of `/etc/passwd` are disclosed.

### **Denial of Service**
- **Billion Laughs Attack (Recursive Entities):**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE lolz [
<!ENTITY lol "lol">
<!ENTITY lol1 "&lol;&lol;&lol;">
<!ENTITY lol2 "&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;">
<!ENTITY lol3 "&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;">
]>
<data>&lol3;</data>
```
- **Outcome:** Parser resource exhaustion.

## üõ°Ô∏è Preventing XXE Vulnerabilities

### **Steps for Secure XML Parsing:**
1. **Disable External Entities:**
   - Example in Python (lxml):
```python
from lxml import etree
parser = etree.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)
```
   - Example in Java:
```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
```

2. **Input Validation and Whitelisting:**
   - Accept only trusted XML inputs.

3. **Use Modern Formats:**
   - Prefer JSON or other non-XML formats where possible.

## üî• Quick Facts for Rapid Review

1. **XXE Risks:** File disclosure, DoS, SSRF.
2. **Attack Indicators:** XML with `<!DOCTYPE>` and `<!ENTITY>` tags.
3. **Prevention Techniques:**
   - Disable external entities.
   - Use safer libraries (e.g., defusedxml in Python).
   - Regularly update dependencies and configurations.

## üöÄ Practice Question for Interviews

1. **Scenario-Based Question:**  
   "An application accepts XML files for processing. How would you test for and secure against XXE?"  
   **Answer:**  
      - Test: Submit XML with external entities referencing sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
      - Secure: Disable external entity processing, use safe libraries, and validate inputs.

2. **Hands-On Task:**  
   "Write a safe XML parser configuration for XXE prevention."

3. **Behavioral Question:**  
   "Describe a time you secured an application against injection vulnerabilities."
