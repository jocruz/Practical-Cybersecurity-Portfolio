# üìÑ Script Summary

### üìÅ **Directory Setup**

- **Purpose**: Prepares the directory structure for storing the outputs of subdomain discovery, screenshots, and scans.
- **Operations**:
    - Checks and creates a main directory named after the domain.
    - Inside the main directory, it creates three subdirectories: `subdomains`, `screenshots`, and `scans`.

### üîé **Subdomain Discovery**

- **Tools Used**: `subfinder`, `assetfinder`, and optionally `amass` (commented out).
- **Operations**:
    - **subfinder**: Searches for subdomains and outputs the results to `found.txt` within the `subdomains` directory.
    - **assetfinder**: Continues the search and appends additional findings to the same `found.txt` file.
    - **amass** (if uncommented): Would add yet more subdomains to `found.txt`.

### üåê **Identify Alive Subdomains**

- **Tools Used**: `httprobe` with support from `grep`, `sort`, `sed`, and `tee`.
- **Operations**:
    - Filters the `found.txt` for unique entries.
    - Uses `httprobe` to test which subdomains are active, focusing on those with HTTPS.
    - Saves the active subdomains to `alive.txt`.

### üñºÔ∏è **Screenshot Active Subdomains**

- **Tool Used**: `gowitness`.
- **Operation**:
    - Takes screenshots of the active subdomains listed in `alive.txt` and saves them to the `screenshots` directory.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Network Scanning**

- **Tool Used**: `nmap`.
- **Operation**:
    - Scans all ports of the active subdomains using a fast and aggressive setting, saving the results in `nmap.txt` within the `scans` directory.

### üöÄ **Execution Flow**

- The script initiates by checking for the necessary directories and creating them if they do not exist.
- It sequentially executes tools to discover subdomains, checks their availability, captures their state via screenshots, and performs a comprehensive network scan.
- Each stage of the script is highlighted with red color-coded messages to indicate the start of a new operation.

### üñ•Ô∏è **Output Management**

- Uses sophisticated text processing commands to filter, sort, and manage outputs effectively, ensuring clarity and usefulness of the data captured.

This summary encapsulates the script‚Äôs purpose, tools, operations, and output management in a structured format that should be clear for any reader on your Notion page.

## üõ† Setup Directories

### 1. **Create Necessary Directories**:

Ensures that the directories for storing subdomains, screenshots, and scan results exist. If they do not, the script creates them.

---

## üîç Subdomain Discovery

### 2. **Tools Used**:

### **subfinder**

`subfinder -d $domain > $subdomain_path/found.txt`

- **Purpose**: Finds subdomains.
- **Command**: `subfinder -d $domain`
- **Output**: Writes to `found.txt` under the `subdomains` directory.

### **assetfinder**

`assetfinder $domain | grep $domain >> $subdomain_path/found.txt`

- **Purpose**: Appends additional subdomains found to the existing list.
- **Command**: `assetfinder $domain | grep $domain`
- **Output**: Appends to `found.txt`.

### **amass** (Commented Out) (takes too long)

`#amass enum -d $domain >> $subdomain_path/found.txt`

- **Purpose**: Also used for subdomain enumeration (not active in this script).
- **Command**: `amass enum -d $domain`

---

## ‚úÖ Checking Alive Subdomains

### 3. **Identify Active Subdomains**:

Sorts and checks which subdomains from `found.txt` are alive using `httprobe`.

- **Tools**: `httprobe`, `sort -u`
- **Output**: Results are saved in `alive.txt`.

---

## üì∏ Taking Screenshots

### 4. **Screenshot Active Subdomains**:

`gowitness file -f $subdomain_path/alive.txt -P $screenshot_path/ --no-http`

Uses `gowitness` to capture screenshots of the active subdomains.

- **Command**: `gowitness file -f $subdomain_path/alive.txt -P $screenshot_path/ --no-http`

---

## üö® Network Scanning

`nmap -iL $subdomain_path/alive.txt -T4 -p- -oN $scan_path/nmap.txt`

### 5. **Scan with nmap**:

Performs a detailed scan on the active subdomains using `nmap`.

- **Command**: `nmap -iL $subdomain_path/alive.txt -T4 -p- -oN $scan_path/nmap.txt`

---

## üß∞ Flags and Tools

### 6. **Explanation of Flags**:

- **Echo `e`**: Interpret color codes and other backslash escapes.
- **Redirection and Pipes**: Use `>`, `>>`, and `|` for managing outputs.
- **Text Tools**: Utilize `grep`, `sort`, `sed`, and `tee` for text manipulation.

## üß© Text Tools Explained

These tools are used in the script for manipulating and processing text data efficiently.

## üîç **grep**

- **Purpose**: Filters and searches text based on patterns.
- **Usage in Script**: It is used to select lines that contain the domain name from the output of other tools.
- **Example**: `assetfinder $domain | grep $domain` filters the output of `assetfinder` to include only lines that contain the domain name.

## üîÑ **sort**

- **Purpose**: Arranges text lines in a specific order.
- **Usage in Script**: It sorts the list of subdomains and removes duplicates to ensure each subdomain is listed once.
- **Example**: `sort -u` sorts lines and `u` flag removes duplicate entries.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è **sed**

- **Purpose**: Edits text based on specific rules, such as substitution, deletion, or insertion.
- **Usage in Script**: In the context of the script, `sed` could be used to modify the output format or content, such as removing unwanted parts of URLs or changing text formats. However, it's noted as a potential tool since it‚Äôs not explicitly used in the provided script lines.
- **Example**: `sed 's/https\?:\/\///'` would remove the 'http://' or 'https://' part from URLs if it were in the script.

## ‚û°Ô∏è **tee**

- **Purpose**: Reads from standard input and writes to standard output and files.
- **Usage in Script**: It writes the output to both the terminal (for immediate viewing) and a file for logging.
- **Example**: `| tee -a $subdomain_path/alive.txt` appends the output to `alive.txt` while also allowing it to be viewed live.
