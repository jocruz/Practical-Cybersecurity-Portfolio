## üõ°Ô∏è Understanding Access Controls

### üìñ Introduction to Access Controls
Access controls are essential security measures that restrict access to resources based on predefined rules. They are critical in ensuring that only authorized users have access to specific functionalities or data within a system.

## üöÄ Types of Access Controls

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Vertical Access Control
- **Definition:**  
  Manages access based on different levels of authority, also known as hierarchical access control. It restricts access to resources based on the user's role within an organization.

- **How it Works:**  
  Enforces policies that provide different access rights to groups of users according to their roles. Typically implemented through role-based access control (RBAC) systems.

- **Example Scenario:**  
  In a hospital information system:  
  - **Doctors:** Access all medical records and can write prescriptions.  
  - **Nurses:** View medical records but cannot write prescriptions.  
  - **Administrative Staff:** Access patient contact information but not medical details.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Horizontal Access Control
- **Definition:**  
  Manages access across users at similar levels of authority but restricts access based on specific criteria or contexts.

- **How it Works:**  
  Rule-based, where rules define what resources a user can access. Commonly used to control access within the same role based on attributes like department, geographical location, or project.

- **Example Scenario:**  
  In a corporate environment:  
  - **Employee A (Marketing):** Access marketing project files but not sales project files.  
  - **Employee B (Sales):** Access sales project files but not marketing files.

## üåü Key Takeaways
- **Vertical Access Controls:**  
  Focus on ‚ÄòWho‚Äô can access resources based on their role and rank in the hierarchy.  
- **Horizontal Access Controls:**  
  Focus on ‚ÄòWhat‚Äô resources users can access based on criteria unrelated to role level but instead on job function or assigned tasks.

## üìö Real-World Applications
- **Vertical Controls:**  
  Common in rigid hierarchies, like military systems or large corporations.  
- **Horizontal Controls:**  
  Useful in organizations with diverse departmental needs, like multinational companies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Tips
- **Implementing Access Controls:**  
  Consider both vertical and horizontal needs to ensure comprehensive security.  
- **Ongoing Management:**  
  Regularly review and update access controls to adapt to changes in organizational structure or personnel.

## üóùÔ∏è Access Controls Simplified

### Vertical Access Control
- **What It Is:**  
  Like having keys to floors in a high-rise building, where each floor represents a different level of authority.  
- **Example:**  
  Only managers get keys to the 10th floor (important meetings), while regular staff can access their own working floors.

---

### Horizontal Access Control
- **What It Is:**  
  Like having keys to different rooms on the same floor, where access depends on specific needs.  
- **Example:**  
  In a hospital:  
  - A cardiologist cannot access oncology records, and vice versa.

---

### Key Points
- **Vertical Control:**  
  Who can access which level? Determined by role's height in the organizational structure.  
- **Horizontal Control:**  
  What specific areas or information can someone access on their level? Determined by job needs or functions.
