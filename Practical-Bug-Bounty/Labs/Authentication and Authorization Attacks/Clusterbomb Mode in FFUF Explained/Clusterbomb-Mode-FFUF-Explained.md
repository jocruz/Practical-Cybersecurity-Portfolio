- Charlie with 123, 456, 789

#### Usage Guidelines ‚úÖ
- **Thorough Testing:**  
  Best used when you need to test all possible combinations, such as during security testing to ensure no combination allows unauthorized access.

- **Command Example:**
  ```bash
  ffuf -request l3request.txt -request-proto http   -w /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt:USER   -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-10.txt:PASS   -mode clusterbomb -o results.csv -of csv
