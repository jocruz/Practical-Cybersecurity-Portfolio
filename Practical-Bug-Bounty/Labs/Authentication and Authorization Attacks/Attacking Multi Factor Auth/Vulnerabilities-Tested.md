# Vulnerabilities Explored 📋

## Authentication Vulnerabilities
1. **Token Applicability:**
   - Can the MFA token be reused for multiple accounts?
2. **Token Strength:**
   - Is the MFA code generated securely, or is it predictable?
3. **Token Usability:**
   - Does the MFA token expire as expected, or can it be used repeatedly?

## Why It Matters 🛡️
Weaknesses in MFA implementations can lead to:
- Account takeovers, even when MFA is implemented.
- Exploitation of shared or improperly validated tokens.
- Loss of trust in secure systems.
