# Vulnerabilities Explored 📋

## Authentication Vulnerabilities
- **Weak Passwords:** The lab tested for the presence of weak passwords in the system.
- **Lack of Brute-Force Protection:** The target system did not implement rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.

## Why It Matters 🛡️
Brute-force vulnerabilities expose systems to unauthorized access, potentially leading to:
- Data breaches.
- Compromise of user accounts.
- Escalation of privileges if an admin account is accessed.
