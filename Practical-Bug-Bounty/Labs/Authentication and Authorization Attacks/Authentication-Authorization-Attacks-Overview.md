---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Understanding Authentication and Authorization**

### **What is Authentication?**
Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity before granting access to a system or resource.  
- **Example:** Entering a username and password to log in.

---

### **What is Authorization?**
Authorization determines what resources a user can access once they are authenticated.  
- **Example:** A regular user can view their profile but cannot access admin settings.

## üö® Common Attacks on Authentication

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Brute Force Attacks**
- **Definition:**  
  Repeatedly attempting different username and password combinations until successful.
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Implement account lockouts after multiple failed attempts.
  - Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Credential Stuffing**
- **Definition:**  
  Using stolen username-password pairs from previous breaches to log into other systems.
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Enforce unique passwords for accounts.
  - Use CAPTCHA to block automated login attempts.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Password Spraying**
- **Definition:**  
  Testing a single password against many usernames to avoid account lockouts.
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Enforce account lockouts.
  - Monitor for unusual login patterns.

## üö® Common Attacks on Authorization

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Broken Access Control**
- **Definition:**  
  Exploiting weaknesses in access control mechanisms to perform unauthorized actions.
- **Example:**  
  Using another user‚Äôs session token to update their profile.
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Validate user roles and permissions.
  - Enforce strict session management.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**
- **Definition:**  
  Accessing unauthorized data by manipulating direct references to objects.
- **Example:**  
  Changing the URL from `account=123` to `account=124` to access another user‚Äôs account.
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Validate user access before serving requested data.
  - Avoid exposing sensitive object references in URLs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools for Testing Authentication and Authorization

1. **Burp Suite with Autorize Extension:**  
   Test session cookies and simulate different user roles.
2. **FFUF:**  
   Automate fuzzing for session and token vulnerabilities.
3. **Hydra:**  
   Perform brute force attacks for testing login security.

---

## üîÑ Summary of Mitigation Strategies

1. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  
   Adds an extra layer of security.
2. **Validate Input and Output:**  
   Sanitize user input to prevent manipulation of authentication and authorization mechanisms.
3. **Session Management:**  
   Use secure session cookies and validate session tokens rigorously.
4. **Regular Security Audits:**  
   Continuously monitor and test authentication and authorization systems.

## üìã Key Takeaways
- Authentication ensures **who you are**, while Authorization ensures **what you can do**.
- Understanding common attack vectors is crucial for building secure systems.
- Always implement **layered security measures** to reduce risk.
