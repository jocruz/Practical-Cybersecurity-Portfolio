# Communicating with Clients and Triagers in Bug Bounty 🗣️

Effective communication is essential in the bug bounty process, serving as the foundation for reporting vulnerabilities, managing client expectations, understanding the role of triagers, ensuring responsiveness, facilitating coordinated disclosure, and handling feedback or disputes. Here’s a detailed guide to mastering communication in bug bounty programs.

### 1. **Effective Communication** ✅

- **Use Official Communication Channels**: Always use the designated platforms for communication to ensure all interactions are documented and official.
- **Clarity and Precision**: Be clear and precise in your communications to avoid misunderstandings.
- **Honest Reporting**: Report vulnerabilities honestly, including potential impacts without exaggeration.
- **Be Patient and Professional**: Maintain professionalism at all times, and be patient while waiting for responses.

### 2. **Reporting Vulnerabilities** 📝

- **Structured Vulnerability Report**: Use a consistent structure for your reports to make it easy for triagers and clients to understand the issue.
    - **Title, Description, Steps to Reproduce, Impact, CWE and CVSS**: Clearly define these elements to provide a comprehensive overview of the vulnerability.
    - **Mitigation Suggestions**: Offer practical steps for resolving the vulnerability.
    - **Proof-of-Concept (PoC)**: Include safe-to-use videos and payloads that demonstrate the vulnerability without causing harm.

    - **Professional and Respectful**: Always conduct yourself professionally and treat all parties with respect.

### 4. **Triager Role** 🌉

- **Bridge Between Researchers and Clients**: Triagers evaluate incoming bug reports and act as intermediaries.

- **Request Additional Information**: Triagers may ask for more details to clarify the report.

### 5. **Responsiveness** ⏰

- **Timely Communication**: Facilitates a quicker resolution process.

- **Adhere to Community Code of Conduct**: Follow standard protocols such as the 30-day waiting period for coordinated disclosure.

### 6. **Coordinated Disclosure** 🔄

- **Structured Disclosure Process**: Manages the public disclosure of vulnerabilities in a controlled manner.
- **Opportunity for Fixing**: Gives clients time to address the issue before public knowledge.
