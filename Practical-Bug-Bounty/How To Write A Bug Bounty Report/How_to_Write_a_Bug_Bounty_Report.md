### How to Write a Bug Bounty Report 📝

Writing an effective bug bounty report is crucial for clear communication between security researchers and organizations. Here's a structured format to help create a comprehensive and professional bug bounty report for your submissions.

---

### 1. **Review the Scope** 🔍

- Ensure the vulnerability exists within the defined boundaries of the bug bounty program. Review the program’s policy to verify that the issue is in-scope.

### 2. **Write the Title** 📄

- Example: "Stored XSS in Forum Comments"
- Keep the title concise and descriptive, focusing on the type of vulnerability and where it occurs.

### 3. **Proof of Concept/Description** 🧪

- Provide a clear, concise description of the vulnerability. Explain how it can be exploited and what the malicious outcome could be.

### 4. **Steps to Reproduce** 👣

- List the steps in a clear, numbered format to allow for easy reproduction of the issue.
- **Example**:
    1. Authenticate into the application and navigate to `https://azena.com/forum/`
    2. In the comment field, inject your payload and hit submit. Example payload: `comment\"><img src=x onerror=alert(domain);>`
    3. Navigate to `https://azena.com/forum/comments` to observe the triggered stored XSS.
- Include screenshots or video links as evidence. Ensure they clearly demonstrate the vulnerability.
