## ðŸ›  Starting and Stopping Services

***In simpler terms:***

***These commands are like the power buttons for various applications on your computer, allowing you to turn them on or off and set them to automatically start when your computer boots up.***

### **Core Service Management Commands**

### **sudo service apache2 start**

- **Function:** Starts the Apache web server service.
- **Example:** `sudo service apache2 start` â†’ Initiates the Apache server for web hosting.
- **Service Explanation:** Apache2 is a popular web server software that hosts websites and web applications.

### **sudo service apache2 stop**

- **Function:** Stops the Apache web server service.
- **Example:** `sudo service apache2 stop` â†’ Stops the Apache server from serving web pages.
- **Service Explanation:** Useful for maintenance or when updating configurations to prevent live errors.

### **python3 -m http.server 80**

- **Function:** Starts a basic HTTP server using Python on port 80.
- **Example:** `python3 -m http.server 80` â†’ Launches a simple server to serve files from the current directory.
- **Service Explanation:** Ideal for testing web pages or temporary file sharing within a network.

### **sudo systemctl enable ssh**

- **Function:** Sets the SSH service to start automatically at system boot.
- **Example:** `sudo systemctl enable ssh` â†’ Ensures SSH is available on startup for remote access.
- **Service Explanation:** SSH (Secure Shell) provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in client-server architecture, allowing secure login from one computer over a network.

### **sudo systemctl disable ssh**

- **Function:** Stops the SSH service from starting automatically on boot.
- **Example:** `sudo systemctl disable ssh` â†’ Prevents SSH from starting up automatically.
- **Service Explanation:** Disabling SSH can enhance security by reducing remote access unless manually started.

### **Comparison with Development Commands**

- **NPM Start Dev/Yarn Dev:**
    - **Explanation:** These commands are used in software development to start a development server for web applications, typically involving Node.js environments.
    - **Context:** While `npm start`, `yarn dev`, or similar commands also start services, they are specifically for development environments and usually watch for file changes to reload the server automatically. They are not used for system-level service management like `sudo service` or `systemctl`.

### **Overview**

- These Linux commands manage system-level services, controlling how essential services like web servers and SSH start or stop and their behavior at boot time. Unlike development commands, these affect how the system operates as a whole rather than just a development environment.
