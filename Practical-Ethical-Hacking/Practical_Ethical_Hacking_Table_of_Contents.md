- Physical and logical components of AD.
- Initial enumeration strategies for AD environments.

---

## 📂 **4. Active Directory Attack Methodology: Enhanced Enumeration and Prioritization**
Step-by-step methodologies for:
- Enumerating AD environments post-compromise.
- Identifying high-value targets within an AD domain.
- Prioritizing attack paths to escalate privileges.

---

## 📂 **5. Attacking Active Directory: Initial Attack Vectors**
Focuses on the first steps to compromising AD, including:
- Common vulnerabilities in AD environments.
- Exploitation techniques like LLMNR poisoning, SMB relay attacks, and Kerberoasting.
- Leveraging Metasploit and other tools for shell access.

---

## 📂 **6. Attacking Active Directory: Post-Compromise Attacks**
Detailed coverage of post-compromise attack strategies, such as:
- Pass-the-Hash and Pass-the-Ticket attacks.
- Golden Ticket and Silver Ticket exploitation.
- Dumping and cracking password hashes.
- Exploiting misconfigurations and cPassword vulnerabilities.

---

## 📂 **7. Attacking Active Directory: Post-Compromise Enumeration**
In-depth techniques for enumerating compromised domains:
- Using tools like BloodHound and ldapdomaindump.
- Mapping relationships and attack paths.
- Leveraging enumeration for privilege escalation.

---

## 📂 **8. Post-Exploitation**
Covers actions to take after gaining access to systems, including:
