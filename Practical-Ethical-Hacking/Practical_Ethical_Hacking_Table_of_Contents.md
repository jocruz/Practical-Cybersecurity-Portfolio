# üõ°Ô∏è Practical Ethical Hacking Course Overview

## **Course Overview**

When I started the Practical Ethical Hacking course, I didn‚Äôt know much about hacking or penetration testing. What drew me in was how hands-on and real-world-focused the course is. It‚Äôs designed for people like me‚Äîsomeone eager to learn the practical aspects of ethical hacking without needing prior experience. All I needed was a positive attitude and a desire to dive in.

Through this course, I gained invaluable knowledge about attacking Active Directory environments using Windows Server 2022. I built my own AD home lab, which was a game-changer for understanding the internal workings of enterprise-level networks. From there, I learned how to apply a variety of attacks, including LLMNR poisoning, pass-the-hash, Kerberoasting, and more.

I also got hands-on experience with industry-standard tools like Metasploit, Kali Linux, CrackMapExec, Mimikatz, NetExec, PsExec, and WmiExec. The course walked me through the entire process‚Äîfrom setting up a lab to post-exploitation strategies‚Äîall in a way that I could see myself using in real-world scenarios.

This wasn‚Äôt just about running tools; it was about understanding the methodology, thinking like an attacker, and figuring out how to defend against the same attacks. The experience has given me a strong foundation in ethical hacking and penetration testing, with a focus on both technical skills and practical applications.
