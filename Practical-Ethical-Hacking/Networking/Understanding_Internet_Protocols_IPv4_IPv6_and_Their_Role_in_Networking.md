## üåê IPv4 vs. IPv6

### **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**

- **Format:** Dotted-decimal, e.g., `192.168.0.1`
- **Size:** 32-bit addresses split into four 8-bit octets
- **Range:** Each octet ranges from 0 to 255
- **Total Addresses:** Approximately 4.3 billion
- **Limitation:** Limited addresses due to internet growth

### **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**

- **Format:** Hexadecimal, e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`
- **Size:** 128-bit addresses divided into eight groups
- **Notation:** Omit leading zeros; consecutive zero groups replaced by `::`
- **Total Addresses:** Approximately 3.4√ó10^38
- **Advantages:** Larger address space, improved security, and auto-configuration

### **Transition to IPv6**

- **Necessity:** Due to depletion of IPv4 addresses
- **Compatibility:** IPv4 and IPv6 are not directly compatible
- **Mechanisms:** Various technologies enable communication between both protocols

## üñß IP in the OSI Model

**Layer:** Network Layer (Layer 3)

- **Role:** IP is responsible for addressing and routing packets to their destination across different networks.
- **Functionality:** Handles path determination and logical addressing. IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6) are crucial at this layer for identifying devices uniquely and globally.

## üÜî What is IP?

### **Definition and Meaning**

- **IP:** Stands for "Internet Protocol."
- **Purpose:** Governs the format of data sent via the internet or local network.

### **Numbers in IP**

- **IPv4:** The number "4" signifies the fourth version of the IP. It uses a 32-bit address system.
- **IPv6:** The number "6" indicates the sixth version, developed to address the shortage of addresses allowed by IPv4. It uses a 128-bit address system.

### **Examples**

- **IPv4 Example:** `192.168.1.1` - Commonly used in home networks.
- **IPv6 Example:** `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` - Example of a global IPv6 address.
