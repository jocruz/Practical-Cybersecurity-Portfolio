***In simpler terms:***

***TCP is used for applications where data must arrive intact and in order, such as accessing websites or sending emails. UDP is used where speed is crucial and minor data loss is acceptable, like in live broadcasts or online games. The Three-Way Handshake is a ritual that TCP uses to ensure both sides are ready and willing to communicate, ensuring data flows smoothly and in the right order.***

## üåê TCP, UDP, and the Three-Way Handshake

### **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

- **Nature:** Connection-oriented protocol.
- **Features:** Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked data delivery.
- **Mechanisms:** Uses acknowledgement, retransmission, and flow control.
- **Applications:** Essential for web browsing, email, file transfers, and remote login.

### **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**

- **Nature:** Connectionless protocol.
- **Characteristics:** Simpler, more lightweight, does not guarantee delivery.
- **Usage:** Suitable for applications that can tolerate data loss, like streaming media, online gaming, DNS, and VoIP.

### **The Three-Way Handshake**

1. **SYN (Synchronize):** Sent by the client to start connection, carrying an initial sequence number.
2. **SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge):** Response from the server with both SYN and ACK flags set, including its sequence number.
3. **ACK (Acknowledge):** Final step where the client sends an ACK back to the server, confirming connection setup.

### **Sequence of Operations**

- **Purpose:** Ensures that both devices are ready to exchange data with correct sequencing.
- **Outcome:** Successful data transmission once the handshake is complete.
