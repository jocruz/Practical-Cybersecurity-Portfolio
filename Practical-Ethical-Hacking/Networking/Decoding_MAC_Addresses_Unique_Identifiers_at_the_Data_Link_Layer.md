***‚ÄúIn simpler terms, the IP address is used for routing data across networks globally, while the MAC address is used to deliver data to the correct device within a local network segment.‚Äù***

## üåê Understanding MAC Addresses

### **Definition of MAC Address**

- **MAC:** Stands for "Media Access Control."
- **Purpose:** Serves as a unique identifier for network interface controllers (NICs) on devices.

### **Characteristics of MAC Addresses**

- **Location:** Found at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
- **Format:** 48-bit address, typically shown as six pairs of hexadecimal digits (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`).
- **Assignment:** Permanently set by the manufacturer and stored in the device‚Äôs firmware or ROM.

### **Function in Networks**

- **Role in Ethernet:** Crucial for communication within local area networks (LAN).
- **Usage:** Encapsulated in Ethernet frames for directing data to the correct device.

### **Manufacturer and Device Identification**

- **First Half:** Identifies the manufacturer (first three pairs of digits).
- **Second Half:** Provides a unique identifier for the specific device (last three pairs).

### **Local Network Relevance**

- **Scope:** Only relevant within the local network segment.
- **Distinction from IP Addresses:** MAC addresses are for local hardware identification, while IP addresses handle global network communication.
