## üåê OSI Model Explained

***In simpler terms:***

***Think of the OSI model as a team of specialists, each handling a specific part of a network communication job, from laying cables to sending emails.***

### **Mnemonic: PDNTSPA**

    - P: Physical
    - D: Data Link
    - N: Network
    - T: Transport
    - S: Session
    - P: Presentation
    - A: Application

### **Overview of OSI Layers**

1. **Physical Layer**
    - **Responsibilities:** Manages the physical transmission of data using cables (e.g., Cat 6).
    - **Function:** Defines the physical characteristics of connections (electrical, mechanical).
2. **Data Link Layer**
    - **Responsibilities:** Ensures reliable data frame transmission and error handling.
    - **Examples:** Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC addresses.
3. **Network Layer**
    - **Responsibilities:** Handles routing and logical addressing of data across networks.
    - **Core Protocol:** IP (Internet Protocol).
4. **Transport Layer**
    - **Responsibilities:** Manages end-to-end delivery of complete messages.
    - **Core Protocols:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
5. **Session Layer**
    - **Responsibilities:** Establishes and manages sessions between applications.
    - **Function:** Session management, including setup and teardown.
6. **Presentation Layer**
    - **Responsibilities:** Translates data formats to ensure application compatibility.
    - **Examples:** Data encryption, compression, WMV, JPEG, MOV formats.
7. **Application Layer**
    - **Responsibilities:** Provides network services directly to user applications.
    - **Examples:** HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and DNS protocols.
