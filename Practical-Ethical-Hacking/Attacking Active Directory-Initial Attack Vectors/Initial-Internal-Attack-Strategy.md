### 🛠️ **Initial Internal Attack Strategy**

---

### 📋 **Summary**:

The initial internal attack strategy focuses on **enumeration**, identifying potential targets like websites, services, and devices with default credentials, and running tools like **mitm6** or **Responder** to capture traffic. The strategy also emphasizes creativity in finding vulnerabilities across the network, even when obvious opportunities (like relays) are unavailable.

### 🛠️ **Detailed Notes**:

1. **Start with mitm6 or Responder**:
    - **mitm6**: Exploit unused IPv6 in the environment to capture traffic via DNS spoofing.
    - **Responder**: Capture credentials by poisoning LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) responses.
2. **Generate Traffic by Running Scans**:
    - Run **network scans** to gather information about the environment.
    - **Example**: Use `nmap` or `http_version` to check for services in scope.
3. **Look for Web Logins with Default Credentials**:
    - Focus on services that are commonly left with default credentials:
        - **Printers (MFPs)**: Try default passwords or launch a pass-back attack.
        - **Jenkins**: Check for common admin credentials.
        - **Other Web Services**: Look for systems with publicly available login portals.
    
    💡 **Tip**: Always try default credentials first (e.g., `admin/admin`) before moving to more complex methods.

### 💡 **Critical Mentions & Exam Traps**:

- **Think Outside the Box**:
    - You might not always get a **perfect relay** during an internal attack. Ask yourself:
        - **What else is on the network**?
        - **Can I exploit devices that are often overlooked**, like MFPs, switches, or outdated services?
    
    **Example**: If relaying doesn’t work, target underutilized devices (like printers) for credential capture using **pass-back attacks** or **default credentials**.
    
- **Ask for Credentials**:
    - Don’t forget that **hackers have unlimited time**. If there’s an opportunity, **request credentials** from someone or manipulate situations where credentials might be created for you (e.g., asking for temp access).

### 📖 **Abbreviations & Definitions**:

- **mitm6**: A tool that performs Man-in-the-Middle attacks over IPv6 by spoofing DNS.
- **Responder**: A tool that captures credentials by poisoning LLMNR and NetBIOS name resolution traffic.
- **Nmap**: A network scanner used to discover hosts and services on a network.
- **Default Credentials**: Pre-set username/password combinations for services (e.g., `admin/admin`), often left unchanged.

### 📌 **Final Thoughts**:

- **Enumeration is Key**: The most critical part of penetration testing is not always the hack itself, but **enumerating** everything on the network.
    - **Enumerate all systems and services** to discover weak points, such as outdated devices or forgotten services.
    - Keep searching for overlooked devices and **unusual entry points** to widen the attack surface.
