## üìù **Summary of the Active Directory Attack Methodology**

The attack methodology focuses on systematically compromising an Active Directory (AD) environment by using enumeration, privilege escalation, and lateral movement techniques to gain control over the domain.

### 1. **Reconnaissance and Initial Access**

- **Network Scanning:** Use Nmap to identify live hosts, open ports, and services running on the network. Look for common weaknesses, such as unsecured services or SMB signing that isn‚Äôt enforced.
- **Responder Attack:** Deploy the Responder tool to poison network requests, capturing NTLMv2 hashes that can later be cracked or reused for authentication.

### 2. **Enhanced Enumeration and Prioritization**

- **Gather Domain Information:** Use `ldapdomaindump` to enumerate users, groups, computers, and policies in the domain, identifying high-value targets like Domain Admins.
- **BloodHound Analysis:** Run BloodHound to map out AD relationships and identify attack paths, privilege escalation opportunities, and vulnerable accounts, such as those with Kerberoastable service accounts.
- **Prioritize Accounts:** Focus on accounts with elevated privileges, weak passwords, or accounts that don't require password expiration (`DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD`).

### 3. **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement**

- **Hash Cracking:** Use captured NTLMv2 hashes and attempt to crack them with Hashcat. Use these cracked passwords or hashes to gain unauthorized access to other machines.
- **Pass-the-Hash and Pass-the-Password:** With the cracked credentials or captured hashes, use CrackMapExec to move laterally across the network by authenticating to other systems and services.
- **Dump Credentials:** Extract credentials from compromised systems using `secretsdump.py` to obtain additional usernames and passwords.
- **Kerberoasting:** Enumerate service accounts and request Kerberos tickets to extract credentials that can be cracked offline.

### 4. **Domain Controller Compromise**

- **Dump NTDS.dit:** If you've identified a Domain Controller, use `secretsdump.py` to extract the NTDS.dit file containing all domain user credentials, focusing on extracting NTLM hashes.
- **Golden Ticket Attack:** If you have access to the `krbtgt` account, generate a Golden Ticket using Mimikatz, giving you persistent and virtually unlimited access to the domain.

### 5. **Persistence and Clean-Up (Optional)**

- **Establish Persistence:** Consider creating new admin accounts for long-term access (only if ethically and legally appropriate).
- **Cover Tracks:** Understand the importance of removing logs and traces of your activities, though this step may not always be necessary in exam scenarios.

### **Key Goals:**

- The primary goal is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities within Active Directory to escalate privileges, move laterally, and eventually gain control over critical domain components, such as Domain Admin accounts and the Domain Controller itself.
- Continuous enumeration and adjustment of the attack strategy are essential, focusing on weak credentials, misconfigurations, and leveraging AD relationships to achieve your objectives.
