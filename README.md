# Cybersecurity Labs: Hands-On Learning in Ethical Hacking and Web Security üîê

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Labs** repository! This is a collection of hands-on labs, home labs, and projects that demonstrate my skills and learning in penetration testing, Active Directory attacks, and web application security. The labs and projects here are based on my coursework and self-study while pursuing certifications like **Practical Ethical Hacking** and **Practical Bug Bounty** by TCM Security.

## Repository Structure üìÇ

### 1. [Practical Bug Bounty Course](./Practical-Bug-Bounty/)
**Focus**: Web Application Penetration Testing  
The **Practical Bug Bounty** course provided a comprehensive introduction to web application security, including the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, reconnaissance, exploitation, and reporting. It also covered advanced topics like bypassing WAFs and automated tools for testing.

- **Key Highlights**:
  - Learned to identify and exploit vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection**, **XSS**, and **Command Injection**.
  - Gained hands-on experience with tools like **Burp Suite**, **DirBuster**, and **Autorize**.
  - Performed reconnaissance using techniques like **subdomain enumeration** and **directory brute-forcing**.
  - Practiced creating effective **penetration testing reports** using CVSS scoring.

**Directory Contents**:
- `README.md`: Overview of the course and its relevance.
- `Vulnerabilities-Tested.md`: Detailed documentation of each vulnerability explored.
- `Screenshots/`: Visual evidence of findings.
- `Findings-Report.md`: Example report with CVSS scoring, remediations, and impact analysis.

### 2. [Practical Ethical Hacking Course](./Practical-Ethical-Hacking/)
**Focus**: Network Penetration Testing and Active Directory Attacks  
The **Practical Ethical Hacking** course was instrumental in building my foundational skills in ethical hacking and penetration testing. It covered everything from reconnaissance to post-exploitation techniques.

- **Key Highlights**:
  - Built and configured a home lab environment for **Active Directory penetration testing**.
  - Exploited vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios using tools like **Nmap**, **Metasploit**, and **Mimikatz**.
  - Practiced attacks like **Kerberoasting**, **LLMNR Poisoning**, **Pass-the-Hash**, and **Golden Ticket**.
  - Enhanced skills in post-exploitation techniques, including **pivoting** and **maintaining access**.

**Directory Contents**:
- `README.md`: Overview of the course and its key takeaways.
- `Lab-Setup.md`: Step-by-step guide to setting up the home lab environment.
- `Commands-Used.md`: Comprehensive list of commands used during the labs.
- `Findings-and-Remediation.md`: Documentation of attacks performed and potential mitigations.

### 3. [Home Lab Setup](./HomeLab-Setup/)
**Focus**: Building and Practicing on a Local Active Directory Lab  
To deepen my understanding of network penetration testing and Active Directory exploitation, I set up a local lab environment using **Windows Server 2022** and client machines. This lab mirrors real-world enterprise environments and allowed me to simulate common AD attacks.

- **Key Highlights**:
  - Created a domain controller and joined two Windows client machines to the domain.
  - Performed attacks like **SMB Relay**, **IPv6 DNS takeover**, and **Kerberoasting**.
  - Documented findings and explored mitigation techniques for common vulnerabilities.

**Directory Contents**:
- `README.md`: Overview of the home lab purpose and components.
- `AD-Lab-Diagram.png`: Visual representation of the lab setup.
- `Tools-Used.md`: List of tools used for exploitation and enumeration.
